#/server/exporters
This directory contains plugins to connect to export external (infected) data sets. 

These will be the points we want to compare against for example Strava datasets.

See /server/exporters/template.js for the API to exporters

#### To Add a Exporter

* Add a tracker file modeled on template.js
* Make edits to index.js to include it
